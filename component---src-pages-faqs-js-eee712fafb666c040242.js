You determine how much you want to borrow from your available credit limit and when you want to draw from your available credit, allowing you to control your finances. You’ll have a minimum payment due each billing cycle, but you’re always allowed to pay more. We will never charge you for paying off what you owe early. The faster you pay down your outstanding balance, the less interest you will accumulate and the more credit will be available for future draws.

A line of credit gives you more flexibility by allowing you to make payments only on the amount that you choose to advance.
