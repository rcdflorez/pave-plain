When you request funds,\n                these are called “draws” or “advances”. With Pave Credit, you\n                can apply for a line of credit from $400 to $3,000. You\n                determine how much you want to borrow from your available credit\n                limit and when you want to draw from your available credit,\n                allowing you to control your finances. You’ll have a minimum\n                payment due each billing cycle, but you’re always allowed to pay\n                more. We will never charge you for paying off what you owe\n                early. The faster you pay down your outstanding balance, the\n                less interest you will accumulate and the more credit will be\n                available for future draws. You are allowed to make additional\n                draws before you have fully repaid your initial draw, if there\n                is available credit on your account and you make all of your\n                payments on time. Each draw will accumulate interest until\n                repaid.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Here’s an example: Let’s say you’re approved for a $1,000 line\n                of credit. If you use $300 for an emergency car repair, then\n                you’ll still have $700 in available credit. You will accumulate\n                interest only on the $300 you have drawn. Your payments will\n                cover both interest and principal, so your available balance\n                will increase with each payment until the total due on the $300\n                draw is repaid and your credit limit is back up to $1,000.\n              </Card.Body>\n            </Accordion.Collapse>\n          </Card>\n          <Card>\n            <Accordion.Toggle as={Card.Header} eventKey=\"1\">\n              IS A LINE OF CREDIT THE SAME THING AS A PAYDAY LOAN?\n            </Accordion.Toggle>\n            <Accordion.Collapse eventKey=\"1\">\n              <Card.Body>\n                No. A payday loan is a short-term loan that must be repaid in\n                full, with interest, on your next payday or payment deadline. A\n                line of credit is different. You can request advances in\n                amount(s) up to your approved credit limit and pay interest only\n                on the advance(s) you receive. A line of credit gives you more\n                flexibility by allowing you to make payments only on the amount\n                that you choose to advance. As long as your account remains in\n                good standing, your line of credit remains available to draw\n                from again. There is no need to re-apply to receive additional\n                funds after your initial advance, simply check your available\n                credit limit before requesting an additional draw.\n              </Card.Body>\n            </Accordion.Collapse>\n          </Card>\n          <Card>\n            <Accordion.Toggle as={Card.Header} eventKey=\"2\">\n              HOW MUCH CAN I BORROW?\n            </Accordion.Toggle>\n            <Accordion.Collapse eventKey=\"2\">\n              <Card.Body>\n                Pave Credit offers lines of credit ranging from $400-3,000.
